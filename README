Ister Cloud Init Service
=======================

This little web application is intended to be a helper for standing up
up n-node clusters of Clear Linux. It complements the Clear Linux
Installer (Ister) and enables landing role-based cloud-init userdata files.
Our proof-of-concept enabled standing up hosts ready to be managed
through ansible.

Generally this would run on the iPXE server that hosts are booting from
to install Clear Linux. See docs on https://clearlinux.org for more details.
